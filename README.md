# RISC-V Spike Simulator SDK

In the recent version of the riscv-tools and freedom-u-sdk, both of them removed the support of the spike simulator, and tutorials about running Linux on spike is using static compiled busybox, which is not suitable for real test environments. Spike is the simplest simulator of RISC-V, it has a very clear description of the instructions, you can apply your ideas and check it for a quick try. The **R**ISC-V **S**pike **S**imulator SDK wants to help people to test design with 64-bit Linux environment on Spike easily, the basic framework is based on Freedom U SDK version 1.0.

This SDK will provide great convenience for the following people who:

* want to run upstream version Linux on Spike
* want to test design in Linux environment with modified spike, gcc and other extension in toolchain
* want to have a overview about embedded system development

This SDK follows the newest Linux Kernel, GNU toolchain and Spike, the functions of each folder in the project are as follows:

|       Folder        |      Description       |   Version   |
| :-----------------: | :--------------------: | :---------: |
|      buildroot      |    Build initramfs     |  2020.02.x  |
|        linux        |      Linux Kernel      |    5.6.10   |
| riscv-gnu-toolchain | GNU Compiler Toolchain |  gcc 9.2.0  |
|     riscv-tools     | Simulator & Bootloader |    master   |
|        conf         |     config for SDK     |             |

## Quickstart
Build dependencies on Ubuntu 16.04/18.04:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install device-tree-compiler autoconf automake autotools-dev    \
curl libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev gawk build-essential bison flex texinfo \
gperf libtool patchutils bc zlib1g-dev libexpat-dev

# for LLVM
sudo apt-get install binutils build-essential gzip zip unzip git make cmake grep \
ninja-build sed python libexpat1-dev libglib2.0-dev libfdt-dev libpixman-1-dev 
  
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Phantom1003/riscv-rss-sdk.git
git submodule update --init --recursive --progress
#	NOTICE: 
# 		If you already have a riscv toolchain, please notice ** DO NOT SET
#		 $RISCV and MAKE SURE NO ORIGIN RISCV TOOLCHAIN IN YOUR $PATH **
make
```

## Software Development

The default process will only build Linux cross-compiler, which has prefix "riscv64-unknown-linux", if you want using newlib, you can use `make newlib` to build, then you can use pk as a kernel to run your program.

The main compile process will run vmlinux on spike directly, to add your test program, you should add your elfs in `./work/buildroot_initramfs_sysroot` and `make` again.

â€‹	**NOTICE**: The test program should use Linux cross-compiler to compile , instead of Newlib cross-compiler.

If the benchmark you choose need some package, you can use `make buildroot-menuconfig` to reconfigure buildroot and `touch buildroot && make` to rebuild. 

Same to linux, if you want to add driver for new devices, `make buildroot-menuconfig` to reconfigure, `touch linux && make` to rebuild.

## If you want to build step by step ...

1. Build RISC-V GNU Toolchain

   The key to build the dynamic link elf is using the correspond kernel version header to build the gnu toolchain, and more kernel version information you can find in `./riscv-gnu-toolchain/linux-headers/include/linux/version.h`, the macro `LINUX_VERSION_CODE` present the kernel version, for example, you can find in this SDK, its value is 328712 = 0x050408, which means 5.4.8. 

2.  Build rootfs   
   Using `buildroot` to help you to build a rootfs, you can add config in `conf/buildroot_initramfs_config` to add package, and you can copy your pre-compiled elf in `work/initramfs_sysroot` to access in Spike.
   And remember, the basic idea of this SDK is to deconfig all the device, because spike is very limited support for devices, specically the Ethernet, so you should not open DHCP.

3. Compile Linux  
   There're some config you need to notice, if you have no output:

```
CONFIG_HVC_RISCV_SBI=y
CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE=n
```

4. Spike  
   The default account and password is root@phantom, following is the terminal log on Linux 5.4.8.
